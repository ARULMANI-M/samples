RAFX_SSAI SDK

RAFX SSAI SDK adopter provides:
  Enables Video Ad, Interactive Ad and Client-Side Ad Tracking with RAF.stitchedAdHandledEvent()
  Common interfaces to App and to RAF
  Custom interfaces to SSAI manifest servers to fetch, ping, parse and compose RAF-Ad Metadata
  AdEvent callbacks and AdPod snap utilities
  Option to configure not using RAF.stitchedAdHandledEvent()


RAFX SSAI Scope
  The adopter calls following RAF APIs
    stitchedAdInit()
    stitchedAdHandledEvent()
    getAds()
    fireTrackingEvents()
  The adopter requests Ad Metadata to SSAI manifest servers and/or subscribe to video stream, parses to RAF Ad Metadata, tracks AdEvents and invokes callbacks.


Callbacks and Snap utility
  When configured not using RAF.stitchedAdHandledEvent(), App is required to set AdEvent callback functions and responsible to fire all AdEvent pixels by using RAF.fireTrackingEvents()
  Adopter provides utility function to App snap the seeked position at the begging or ending of AdBreak when the new seeked position fall in the middle of AdPod.

How To Playback SSAI Content with Adopter
Adopter must be instantiated in a Task, and used only within the Task. Actual parameters to adopter API are vary. See each SSAI sample and how-to bellow this section. The steps to playback SSAI content is:

Load and initialize adopter
Make initial request to SSAI manifest server
Configure adopter, content and SGNodes
Playback loop
Handle Callbacks
